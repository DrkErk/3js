- X is delete
- unlink stuff would be (press a to select all and then (f3 search) unlink object and data
- Top right of the viewport with the two circles (overlay) is option to use "face orientation" (allows you to see if the face will have issues)
- TO FIX ABOVE: click on all the faces and (f3 search) flip OR if its a multiple meshes together and one is red: (f3 search) recalculate outside (edit mode only)
-
- SCALE IN EDIT MODE SO THAT THE SCALE IS ALWAYS 1 or have unwrapping issues
- (select all and CTRL + A to readjust to center point

- 2 ways to unwrap objects. "smart" and manually
-
- TO UNWRAP UVS MANUALLY, (click object, edit mode, press u, unwrap
-
-CTRL L to select only the mesh. (ie 1 fence post of the fence)
-
-When you have the viewport for the UVs, go to the double circle for show overlays and display stretch: area
- and try and get all the area colors to match (blue in current case)
-
- TO BAKE: in obj mode, with an extra view, click new image and set up the photos params
- After you get your image, click image to save. then save as an hdr
- add another view  and set to shader editor. Then shift A while having the mouse in the view and add a texture/shader texture
-
-To bring out the smaller views side bar press n
-
-alt s to  save the side views
-
-If you need to rebake the baked hdr. only select the objects that need to be backed and move the unwrap of them and rebake.
- make sure that "CLEAR IMAGE" IS NOT CLICKED
