    Varyings in depth:
        -Be thoughtful for what goes in vertex vs fragments
            -values can be linearly interpolated work great
                -position as an example
                -halfway between pos p1 and p2 is mix(p1, p2, 0.5);
            -some values are close enough,
                -ie normals
                -renormalizing them in the frag shader is often the good enough
            -some calculations should be done in the FRAG SHADER!!!
                -if interpolating causes issues (or just teslate enough)
